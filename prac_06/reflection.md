CP1404 Practical Reflection

What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I think I changed how I start my prac work. Before I just start coding right away, 
but now I try to read the instructions properly and plan what I need to do.
I also test my code step by step instead of waiting until the end to see if it works.

What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I still need to manage my time better. Sometimes I start too late and then I feel rushed.
I also need to focus more when I’m coding because I get distracted easy and then forget what I was doing.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I think I’m doing well with keeping my code neat and following PEP8.
I use comments and docstrings more now, and I’m starting to understand classes better.
I also commit my work often which helps me not lose progress.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to stop copying example code without fully understanding it.
Sometimes I just want it to work fast but then later I forget how it works. 
I should slow down and think more about the logic.

What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
Maybe have more examples or small projects that show how to use the stuff we learn together.
